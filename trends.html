        <h5 class="card-title"><strong>Haircuts</strong></h5>
        <p class="card-text">I encourage trimming or cutting your hair to shape your curls. However, since I also want length, I do not cut my hair more than twice a year. I cut it at the beginning of the year then get it trimmed after 6 months or whenever needed. When your hair it is healthier, Ih has less breakage, you get more movement, and more importantly, more self-confidence. One thing I do want to mention is when getting your curls shaped, it is super expensive and can cost you anywhere from $100-$350 depending on where you go. They call it the "Diva Cut", "Curl Shape Cuts", or "RI CI cut‚Äù.I think spending that much on hair is ridiculous. Many people are capitalizing on this natural hair trend. Some of these salons are also charging you for a consultation <b>a consultation</b> just to talk about your hair.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title"><strong>Aztec Clay Mask</strong></h5>
        <p class="card-text">The Aztec Clay Mask is an "Indian Healing Clay", that many naturalistas are using. If you want to try this mask there are tons of YouTube videos. Although, I was skeptical about trying this. I tried it twice and I actually liked the results. I will not vouch for this product since I only used it twice but it did make my curls pop! Before trying new products I recommend doing a test spot, this way you can see if you have any allergic reactions to any products you try. From my research, this is a healthier more natural ingredient to use for both skin and hair.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title"><strong>OILS - OILS - OILS</strong></h5>
        <p class="card-text">Where do I begin?  After years of experimenting, I believe the oils dry your hair <b>OUT</b>. The majority of hair companies are advertising and selling many hair products that claim the hair oils will grow your hair. This is far from the truth. If you start observing your hair after putting these oils and other products you will begin to realize it is actually drying your hair then moisturizing it. Although many oils do have many health benefits, I am no longer putting this in my hair.</p>

          <b> Popular Oils</b>
          <li>Neem</li>
          <li>Castor</li>
          <li>Coconut</li>
          <li>Olive</li>
          <li>Hemp</li>
          <li>Peppermint</li>

        <h5 class="card-title"><strong>Working In Corporate America With Natural Hair</strong></h5>
        <p class="card-text">Many naturals do not feel comfortable wearing their hair natural either because they fear judgment from their coworkers or management will judge them. My last job one of my friends were told to "comb her hair before work"... There wasn't anything wrong with her hair it just wasn't up to their standards. I am happy these days are over. More and more woman is starting to embrace who they are and what they stand for. I see many naturalistas now going to work with their hair in afros, twist, etc. I for one didn't feel comfortable wearing my hair natural when I was a manager. My boss was so concerned about the companies image I wanted to maintain that image. I then began to question myself, what image?  I felt more confident rocking my natural tress. They had to accept me for who I was not how I looked. Woman I say to you "Be Free, Be You, For You".</p>
