          <h4 class="title">NAYHairtips.com</h4>
          <p>I started this informative blog to open awareness on some of the <b>Natural</b> hair products that can affect our skin as well as our health. We may be obsessed with the many  different bloggers on YouTube, Facebook or Instagram however, we may want to slow down on trying everything they suggest. We were "not" all made equal. We all have different hair textures, hence what works for others may not necessarily work for you. I acknowledged that we all want to look beautiful and go to great length to do it, however, be careful what you are putting on your skin.</p>

          <p>I started having adverse reactions from highly marketed hair products and hair vitamins. The ingredients that are in some of these hair products can be very harmful to your skin. The sellers are advertising as "Natural" but they are <b>clearly</b> not natural. I also started paying attention to my pockets and noticed I was supporting people with false advertisement.  I spent $30 on hair vitamins, $18 on a conditioner, $9 on a butter/creme, and $15 on shampoo. This totaled to $72. Not to mention I purchased a diffuser for $50 and deep treatments in between. Keep in mind, most of these newly packaged products are so small you can only use it a few times. I wanted to document how much I was spending on different products for a year. Since I use to purchase products on impulse, every time I wanted to purchase something at the store I would immediately send the money to my bank account. After 5 months I saved $380 and in a year $864. This means I could have saved approx. $1000 for the year. I vowed to never purchase a product that wasn't 100% natural and ensure it was worth the price. I cleaned out my stock, returned things to Sally Beauty Supply store and started purchasing actual natural brand hair products. I stopped taking random vitamins that YouTube suggested but listen to my doctor.  </p>
          
        
          <p>The fact of the matter is to think twice before putting different products on your skin. Some of these products can cause some serious illness. If we don't take care of ourselves who will? There is a huge market for being natural. We feed into all of the boast, hype, and believe everything we hear. Most cultures wear their natural hair. Embrace who you are... Do what is right for you.
