                  <p>My name is Naomy!
                  I went natural in about 5 years ago. 
                  I went through ups and downs with my transition. 

                  I recall as a kid, everything was so much simpler.
                  I never had to purchase stacks of  products. I began to do some 
                  research and found out a few things that 
                  I will discuss in this blog.
              </p>

                <p>
                    This website is to educate our african american community on products that we are putting on our skin/hair.

                  <p class="card-text">Before many folks went natural In the black community, we got perms to straighten hair. Faithfully woman went every six months for a touch-up. Perm have hazardous chemicals and is very toxic. One of the ingredients is called Ammonium Thioglycolic acid with a very strong smell like ammonia. This causes irritation on the skin and can cause severe burns and irritation to the scalp causing alopecia and other scalp diseases. It made your hair thin, dry, brittle, lead to excessive breakage, breathing problems and much more. We still managed to put this nasty smelly product in our hair and didn't have a clue what was in there. The perception of beauty was having straight hair. No matter how many times people got burned, that didn't stop anyone from continuing to get a perm. Chris Rock documentary <strong>"Good Hair"</strong>  was a very good documentary. It was the truth about our African American culture. Let's start paying attention to the big picture. Some people do nails and never have fake nails on, same for hair extensions. We need to get it together and love who we are.

                  <h5 class="card-title"><b>The Goal</b></h5>
              <p class="card-text">Some of us inspire to have a nice curly texture of our liking. Just always remember that we don't all have the same texture and genes. There are also product makers that swear their products will make your hair curlier and grow longer. We need to stop focusing on what everyone else is doing and again simply do what works for you. What you do with your body also affects your hair. If you eat healthy, exercise and take the necessary vitamins your body needs, your hair and body will thank you. If you do not eat proper nutrients you can experience different issues with your hair and body. If all of the products that said it will grow your hair, I think many of us would be walking around with longer than shoulder length hair. We all have our own natural curl pattern, embrace it! We need to pay attention to false advertisement stating your hair will grow, any product that promises to change your curl pattern be weary, READ the labels and understand the effects.
