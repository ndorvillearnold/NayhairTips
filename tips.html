              <b>Wash Your Hair:</b>
              Wash Your Hair People, wash your hair! Many people are boasting about co-washing. I would recommend washing either weekly or bi-weekly depending on how many products you have put on your hair throughout the week. Think about it! Do you remember doing LOC, LO, LCO method when you were young? <b>NO!</b> Do less - less is better when it comes to your hair. Leave your HAIR alone. Figure out what works for you.
          
              </p>
          
          
              <p>
                  <b>Moisture:</b> 
                  Moisture: One thing that I have noticed works for me is putting products in the shower believe it or not. It may take longer to dry but it works. Keep in mind, I can only vouch for "actual natural products". If you are using products with alcohol and ingredients you can't pronounce be careful, period. The products you use has a lot to do with the moisture your hair retains. Oils: Some oils make your hair extremely dry. Pay attention to what your hair is saying. If you see your hair frizzing, becoming very dry do not continue using the oil. From experience, coconut oil can also make your hair super dry. If your skin begins to itch stop using the product/oil.

              <p>
                    <b>Products:</b> 
                    Stop Hoarding products in your bathroom. Once you find what works for you, use it. It is ok to try new things just keep in mind what works for others may not work for you. I can't stress this enough.
              </p>

              <b>Healthy Habits</b> 
              Healthy Habits You diet also has a lot to do with your hair growth. I am not asking you to go and take all of those fancy hair vitamins everyone is selling however, I would suggest taking healthy vitamins (approved by your doctor). Life is so simple! Eat right, exercise and use natural only hair products. Drink plenty of water.
              
              </p>
          
              <p>
                <b>Patience:</b> 
                Be Patient! You do not have to look like everyone else. Be free, be you! It may take time for your hair to grow due to genetics, diet, routine, etc. Just give your self time and discover your own routine.
